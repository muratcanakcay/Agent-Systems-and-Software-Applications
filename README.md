# Agent-Systems-and-Software-Applications

These are the code snippets from the labs and the homeworks I have done for the 6th Semester "Software Agent Systems and Applications" Course in the Computer Science B.S. program at Politechnika Warszawa. There are three homeworks: 
1: Using Python library SPADE
2: Using Java library JADE
3: Using Python library OSBrain

Each homework is distinct and the description of the task is also included in the homework's directory.
