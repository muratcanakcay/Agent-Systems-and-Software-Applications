We assume that there is a customer in the system, represented by ClientAgent agent, who wants to order take-out food from a restaurant. In the system, there are many restaurants that offer their services (they advertise them in the Directory Facilitator; DF agent). Each restaurant is represented (for "external communication") by a GatewayAgent agent. 

In addition, in each restaurant, there is a ManagerAgent agent, known only to the GatewayAgent, which is responsible for the management of the restaurant (it knows what dishes and when can be prepared). 

Restaurants inform (as part of DF) what types of cuisine they offer (e.g., French, Polish, Spanish, Japanese). 

In the first step, the ClientAgent asks the DF agent for a list of restaurants serving dishes of the selected cuisine (e.g., Basque cuisine). If there is no restaurant with the selected type of cuisine, they receive a negative answer. 

If there are such restaurants, it receives (from DF) a list of GatewayAgent agents with which it can communicate in order to place an order. 

ClientAgent sends CallForProposal to these agents, with a request for specific dishes, for a specified number of people, for a specified time. GatewayAgent queries the ManagerAgent about the possibility of accepting the received order. 

ManagerAgent responds yes (and gives the cost of executing such an order) or no (according to the rule invented by you). 

ClientAgent selects the restaurant (randomly or according to your own rule) and the final phase of the CallforProposals follows â€“ as defined under the FIPA standard.
