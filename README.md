# Agent-Systems-and-Software-Applications

These are the code snippets from the labs as well as the homeworks I have done for the 6th Semester "Software Agent Systems and Applications" Course in the 
Computer Science B.S. program at Politechnika Warszawa. There are three homeworks: 

1) Using Python library SPADE, a multi-agent systems platform written in Python and based on instant messaging (XMPP).
2) Using Java library JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework).
3) Using Python library OSBrain, a general-purpose multi-agent system module written in Python and developed by OpenSistemas.

Each homework is distinct and the description of the task is also included in the homework's directory.
