The goal of this homework to implement an agent-based mini-system that explores features of the osBrain platform.

Speed dating simulation

There are 2 types of agents: initiators (which start conversation) and responders (which wait for the message and reply).
The number of initiators and responders is equal and it should be a parameter of the simulation.
There is also the organizer agent who assigns initiators their interlocutors.
At the beginning (and every n seconds) the organizer assigns each initiator their new interlocutor (the responders are passiv and only respond to messages).
The conversation is a simple message exchange (e.g. "Hey, do you like X?" - "Yes."/"No.").
The initiator asks one question per round and chooses a random interest from its list.
Each initiator and responder has x interests assigned randomly from a fixed list, e.g. "sports", "traveling", "agent systems".
After any initiator gets a confirmation message, they send a message to the organizer who shuts down everything announcing the first agents who matched (the shutdown mechanism can also be implemented differently as long as it is "graceful").
The organizer does not wait for the confirmations of match/no match from agents.
It assigns new interlocutor every n seconds.
