Instructions:

There are 3 agents.
The initial state in agent one and two is "counting".
2 agents count in turns (first agent prints 1, sends this counter to another agent, then the second agent prints counter+1 and sends back counter+1)
At some point (i.e. PeriodicBehaviour) the third agent starts trying to interrupt by randomly sending first and second agent random numbers.
First and second agent have a chance (library random) to make a mistake. If they get distracted they send the other agent the number which they got from the third agent (instead of counter+1). It also changes the state (FSMBehaviour) to "distracted".
